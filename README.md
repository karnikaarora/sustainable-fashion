## ✨ About

Merlin Fashion is a front-end clothing website that presents a vibrant fashion collection with smooth UI and interactive visuals. I customized and enhanced the design using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, focusing on a clean layout, better styling, and an engaging user experience.

The project doesn't use any frameworks or databases — it’s a pure frontend template that reflects a minimalist, modern take on e-commerce fashion sites.
